# Hi, I'm Lalit Sharma

Full-stack developer who enjoys building things from scratch, breaking them at scale, and then calmly fixing them with better architecture.

Currently shipping code, dashboards, SDKs, and the occasional existential thought about state management.

---

## What I Do (Mostly on Purpose)

- Designing clean, boring-in-a-good-way APIs
- Turning raw events into dashboards people actually understand
- Obsess over **DX**, clean APIs, and not waking up to things broken by RegEx.

I enjoy problems that start with *“we just need a small feature”*  and end with *“okay, we need proper architecture now.”*

---

## Projects I’ve Built (Yes, From Scratch)

### Pulseboard
A self-hosted analytics platform because I thought,  
> “How hard can analytics be?”

Turns out: *hard enough to be fun.*

**Highlights:**
- Custom JS SDK with offline buffering & batching
- Queue-based ingestion pipeline
- Near real-time dashboards (React + Recharts)
- Designed end-to-end: SDK → APIs → backend → UI

> Built it because product analytics should be **transparent, controllable, and not a black box**.

---

### Coompiler
A web-based playground for experimenting with code & ideas without overthinking setup.

---

### Palette Studio
Because developers also need opinions about colors, not just semicolons.

---

### Comfy Store
An e-commerce frontend experiment proving once again that *state management is harder than it looks.*

---

## Tech I Regularly Argue With

**Frontend:**  
React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, Recharts

**Backend:**  
Node.js, Express, REST APIs, SDK design

**Data & Infra:**  
PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana

**Other:**  
Queues, batching, buffering, dashboards, system design diagrams at 1 AM

---

## Currently

- Part of an **Agentic AI team at Cadence**
- Exploring where **analytics meets intelligent systems**
- Still refactoring things that technically already work

---

## Developer Philosophy

- If it’s not observable, it *will* break silently  
- If the API feels awkward, someone will misuse it  
- If it works in production, **document how**

---

## Let’s Talk

If you want to:
- Build dashboards
- Design SDKs
- Talk analytics architecture
- Or debate why frontend bugs feel more personal

You’ll probably enjoy the conversation.

*PS: Yes, I test in production — but only after staging approves it.*
